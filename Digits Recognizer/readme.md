<h1>Handwritten Digit Recognizer using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This project aims to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that can recognize handwritten digits with high accuracy. The dataset used is provided by Keras, and the model has been trained and tested to achieve an accuracy of 97.7%.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used is the Keras-built-in dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).

<h2>Model Architecture</h2>
The ANN model consists of an input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer. The hidden layer has been added to improve the model's performance.

<h2>Model Performance</h2>
The model has achieved an accuracy of 97.7% on the testing dataset.

<h2>Technical Details</h2>
- Programming Language: Python
- Framework: Keras
- Dataset: Keras-built-in dataset
- Model Architecture: ANN with one hidden layer
- Accuracy: 97.7%

<h2>Future Scope</h2>
This project can be further improved by:

- Increasing the number of hidden layers
- Tuning hyperparameters
- Using different optimization algorithms
- Using other datasets for training and testing
